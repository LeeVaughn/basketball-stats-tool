# Basketball Stats Tool
This console based application takes a list of team and player data, cleans and formats the data for presentation. The user can then interact with the application to display statistics for the selected team

## Motivation
This is my take on the second project in Treehouse's Python Techdegree program.

## Features
* The user is prompted with instructions on how to select a team or quit the application
* If the user enters a team name, statistics for that team are shown and then the user is reprompted to choose a team or quit the application.
* If the users type "Quit" the application ends
* User input works for upper or lower case input
* Exceptions are raised and handled if the user enters something outside of the expected results
* Player height property is converted from a string to an integer for presentation
* Player experience is converted from a string to a boolean for presentation
* Player guardian is converted from a string to a list for presentation
* Team statistics include team name, number of players, number of experienced and inexperienced players, average player height, player names, and guardian names

## Future Improvements
* Streamline printing of stats in display_stats function
